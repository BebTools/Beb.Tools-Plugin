Beb.Tools - Zero All Rotations Script
=====================================

Description:
This script sets the rotation of all mesh
objects in the scene to (0, 0, 0) degrees
on the X, Y, and Z axes.

Usage:
1. Add mesh objects (e.g., cubes) to your scene.
2. Open the N-Panel (press N).
3. Go to the "Beb.Tools" tab.
4. Select "zero_all_rotations" from the list.
5. Click "Apply" to run the script.

What It Does:
